<h1>Sonnet 61: Addicted to Love?</h1>

<p>The lights are off. You’re settled into bed. All you want to do is sleep. Unfortunately your brain has other ideas. Instead of quieting down for the night it starts playing a highlights reel of your beloved. There’s no chance of shutting it off. You go over every moment shared together. Every mental picture snapped and committed to memory. It’s torture - like when you have a song stuck on loop in your head – but infinitely worse because the images conjure with them all manner of accompanying thoughts that make sleep impossible.</p>

<p>English rock singer Robert Palmer captured the feeling in his eighties hit, ‘Addicted to Love’: “You can't sleep/you can't eat/There's no doubt, you're in deep/Your throat is tight, you can't breathe
/Another kiss is all you need.” Little did he know Shakespeare had beaten him to it over 350 years earlier.
What’s so interesting about Sonnet 61 is how the poet debates the agency behind his tortured night’s sleep. The three questions expressed in the octet are all asking the same thing: is it you, my love, beaming these images into my head? The frenzied repetition smacks of obsession, exposing the poet’s love-sick state. The assigning of blame also leads us to question his state of mind. The fact his first thought is that his beloved may be actively willing his sleeplessness hints at a poisonous relationship – with the poet casting himself as the victim of a manipulative other.</p>

<p id="blog-padding">Worse still is the self-pitying tone of the following sestet. Here the poet claims the love he has for his adored is greater than they have in return for him. It’s never a good sign when one half of a couple starts questioning the depth of feeling held by the other. It smacks of insecurity and betrays a mind riven by doubt and suspicion, not to mention a fatal absence of self-esteem. In the lines: “It is my love that keeps mine eye awake:/Mine own true love that doth my rest defeat” this gross self-pity is at its most evident.</p>
